        <h1>How To Play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h1>
        <h2>Pick a stage</h2>
            <p>Each field is shaped differently. 
                Quite a few have hazards, and all have Easter Eggs.
                Each stage has background music based on which game series it's from -GERUDO VALLEY, BRO!
            </p>
        <h2>Pick a character</h2>
        <p>I suggest using one of the first 5 characters because they are simple and broken.
             There are several complicated fighters.
             There are several BROKEN fighters. Click <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/fighter/">this link</a> to learn more
              Once your character is selected, you can change its appearance with L/R. 
            Each fighter has their own moveset, speed, and weight. </p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>X and Y are jump buttons. Winged and Balloon-like characters can jump 3+ times.</li>
            <li>B is special smash.</li>
            <li>A is basic smash.</li>
            <li>Left stick is charged attack. </li>
            <li>Right stick is moving.</li>
            <li>L, R, ZL, and ZR are grab/shield buttons.</li>
            <li>Arrow buttons are taunts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <div><p>There are three different ways to fight. Time- most KOs wins, Stock- be the last one with lives left, and Stamina- self-explanitory.</p>
                </div> 
               <div> <p>The more damage you take, the farther you'll fly when hit next time.</p></div>

               <div> <p>Items may drop in. They can summon assist fighters, be hinderances, or affect fighters.</p></div>

               <div><p>Final Smashes are your most powerful attack. They are obtained from smash balls, charging your FS meter, and summoning Victini.
                The FS meter charges faster with the more damage you sustain. Attacks also charge it, but not as much.
                When a fighter can Final Smash, the screen will darken and the fighter will glow a rainbow of destruction.
                When an opponent is close by and level with you press B, because most Final Smashes require you to hit your opponent to activate.</p></div>
